        Singapore is one of the great cities of the world, with its blend of Asian and European cultures. Founded as a British trading colony in 1819, since independence it has become one of the worldâ€™s most prosperous city states and boasts one of the worldâ€™s busiest ports.

        Graceful colonial buildings co-exist alongside centuries-old street markets and modern high-rises. Though the government can be strict with residents and visitors who misbehave, travelers who follow the rules canâ€™t help but be fascinated by this multi-cultural city.
        Singapore has been described as a playground for the rich, and it's true that the small city-state does have a certain sheen of wealth. But Singapore offers more than just high-end shopping malls, luxury hotels, and fine dining (though it's worth indulging in those a bit if you can). There is also a vibrant history and diverse ethnic quarters to discover, along with many family-friendly attractions and lovely public spaces that make visiting this slightly futuristic city worthwhile.

        Singapore has an excellent public transportation system that makes getting around convenient and easy. Once you've gotten a sense of the metro map, you'll have no problem zipping from one part of town to the next. English is spoken everywhere, and signs are in English as well. In fact, Singapore is one of the easiest and most comfortable countries to navigate in Southeast Asia. And as long as you're not comparing prices to nearby Thailand or Vietnam, you're in for a lovely stay.
