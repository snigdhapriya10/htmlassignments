        Modern Architecture depended on utilizing novel construction techniques and materials like reinforced concrete, steel, and glass. This architectural style was very “in”, <span class="a2">especially for government buildings and universities,</span> until the 1980s where it started to face strong competition from other <span class="a1">new schools like postmodernism and neomodernism.</span>

     The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the <span class="a3">southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. </span> It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.

        The Victoria Memorial in Calcutta is the most effective symbolism of British Empire, built as a monument in tribute to Queen Victoria's reign. The plan of the building consists of one large central part covered with a larger dome. Colonnades separate the two chambers. Each corner holds a smaller dome and is floored with marble plinth. 
        The memorial stands on 26 hectares of garden surrounded by reflective pools.

    <p class="firstpara" style="font-size: 130%;">Iconic architecture is defined as buildings and spaces that are famous for professional architects and/or the public at large and have <span class="a3">special symbolic/aesthetic significance attached to them</span></p>
    <p class="secondpara" style="font-size: 130%;" >>Modern architecture is the school of design that prevailed since the turn of the 20th century until World War II. The horrendous war altered the kind of buildings needed in the post-war era. People needed practicality and functionality more than ever to rebuild—from scratch—the entire cities that were demolished at the time. The dominant Beaux-Arts and neoclassical architecture, back then, had to subside to make way for a new architectural style that can meet the public needs. This is how Modern architecture arose and there are architecture icons that define postmodernism from the 20th century.</p>
