    <h3>
        <p>To describe<span style="color: red;" > someone’s height</span>, you can say they are tall or short. Tall
            people are higher than short people. Someone who is thin and tall can be called lanky. To say someone is
            short and also small, you can say they are petite. If you’re talking about a child, they might be
            pint-sized.</p>
        <p><span style="color:red"> who weighs more than</span> average can be curvy, well-built, full-bodied <span
                style="color:red"> or heavy.(Curvy is usually only used to describe women.)You might also say someone
                has some meat on their bones. this is a casual way of saying they are overweight,and it might seem rude
                to someone sensitive. The opposite of overweight can be thin, slim or skinny</span>.</p>
        <p>Light,<span style="color:red">Yellowish colour</span> can be described as blonde. But you can also call a
            person who has that kind of hair a blonde.(This means blonde can be used as a noun or an adjective.) A
            person with drk hair can be called a brunette. Someone with red hair can be called a redhead </p>
        <p class="p3">if someone dresses well <span style="color: red;">they are smartly dressed</span> or they look
            smart, you can also just say they are
            well-dressed. if someone dresses fashionably, they are stylish or trendy. if someone has bad taste in
            clothes. they are unfashionable </p>
        <p style="color:#ffbe0d"> Many people have mannerisms that appear when they are feeling negative (bad) emotions.
            If someone feels nervous or impatient , for example, they might tap teir fingers, crack their knuckles, bite
            their fingernails or chew the tips of their pencils. </p>
